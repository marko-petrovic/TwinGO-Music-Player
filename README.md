TwinGO Music Player 
..is just another case of modifying old good Vanilla Music Player. 

Its main purpose was to be a music player for myself while driving my old Renault Twingo. Therefore comes design, colors, and so on.

Any idea what kind of functionality to add in context of music player that's used while driving are more than welcome, so mail me :)

So far, I can remember of adding equalizer and possibly some simple audio visualiser.  Mph along with kmh for speedometer. etc.
